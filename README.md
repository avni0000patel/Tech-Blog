# Tech-Blog
In this project I have created a tech blog. The app follows the MVC paradigm using handlebars as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. This CMS-style blog site is similar to a Wordpress site. This site allows a developer to publish a blog post and comment on other developer's blog post.
