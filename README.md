# Tech-Blog
In this project I have created a tech blog that is a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site. The app follows the MVC paradigm using handlebars as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. This site allows a developer to publish a blog post and comment on other developer's blog post.
